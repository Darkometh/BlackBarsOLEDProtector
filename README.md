# BlackBarsOLEDProtector
Covers black bars with blur and mirrored screen for Widescreens
Fairly niche problem, but it annoyed me enough to make something about it — figured others might want it too. Whether you're on an OLED or just hate the empty void those black bars leave, this might help.

🟢 What it does:

Mirrors your game screen into the side black bars

Applies a customizable blur + opacity

Meant to protect OLEDs from burn-in or just fill the space better

Zero interaction with game files — it's just visual

🛠️ How to use:

Launch the app – run the .exe, and the control panel opens

Select Left & Right Bars – drag over the black bar areas

Overlay activates – mirrored blur fades in on both sides

Tune the sliders – opacity, blur strength, and scale to taste

Optional: Flip source direction or disable overlay with a button
